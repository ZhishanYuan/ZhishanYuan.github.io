Hi, everyone! My name is Zhishan Yuan. I am a senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Now I am working as an research intern at Lenovo, Shanghai[Lenovo Website](https://www.lenovofuturecenter.com/overview/shanghai), taking the responsibilty of evaluating LLMs on different datasets. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. I once went to Imperial College to attend Data Science Summer School and got Grade A in 2024, where I accomplished brain tumor segmentation based on UNet. Now I am looking for a Computer Science PhD position starting from 2025 fall. If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me through email! 

Publication
======
I am now having no publications, but I hope I can publish some high-quality papers during my PhD career.

Projects
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
