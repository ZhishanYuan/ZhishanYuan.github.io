Hi, everyone! My name is Zhishan Yuan. I am a senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. During the last four years, I studyed hard and was lucky to get the honor called "Outstanding Undergraduate in terms of Academic Performance", which was only awarded to top 1% undergraduates at Hust.

I once went to Imperial College to attend Data Science Summer School in 2024, where I accomplished brain tumor segmentation based on UNet. Now I am working as an research intern at Lenovo, Shanghai [Lenovo Website](https://www.lenovofuturecenter.com/overview/shanghai), taking the duty of evaluating LLMs on different datasets. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In my daily life, I am interested in sports, music and movies. I love both soccer and basketball, and I love to go to the gym. I enjoy listening to Rock and R&B in my leisure time.

Now I am looking for a Computer Science PhD position starting from 2025 fall. You can find my curriculem Vitae here. [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/ZhishanYuan/ZhishanYuan.github.io/blob/master/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me through email! 

Publication
======
I am now having no publications, but I hope I can publish some high-quality papers during my PhD career.

Projects
======
In this part, I put some side projects on this website. Hope it can be interesting to you!

Imperial College Summer School
------
I attended Imperial Data Science Summer School in 2024 and accomplished Brain Tumor Segmentation based on UNet. I demonstrate my work report and the final result here. I hope AI can be ultilized to benefit human beings in many aspects, especially in healthcare.
