Hi, everyone! My name is Zhishan Yuan. I am a senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. During the last four years, I studyed hard and was lucky to get the honor called "Outstanding Undergraduate in terms of Academic Performance", which was only awarded to top 1% undergraduates at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I once went to Imperial College to attend Data Science Summer School and got Grade A in 2024, where I accomplished brain tumor segmentation based on UNet. Now I am working as an research intern at Lenovo, Shanghai [Lenovo Website](https://www.lenovofuturecenter.com/overview/shanghai), taking the responsibilty of evaluating LLMs on different datasets. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In my daily life, I am interested in sports, music and movies. I love both soccer and basketball, and I love to go to the gym to do some exercises. I love listening to Rock and R&B in my leisure time.

Now I am looking for a Computer Science PhD position starting from 2025 fall. If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me through email! 

Publication
======
I am now having no publications, but I hope I can publish some high-quality papers during my PhD career.

Projects

In this part, I put some side projects on this website. Hope it can be interesting to you!

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
