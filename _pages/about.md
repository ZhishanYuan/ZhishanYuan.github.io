Hi, everyone! My name is Zhishan Yuan. I am a senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. During the last four years, I studyed hard and was lucky to get the honor called "Outstanding Undergraduate in terms of Academic Performance", which was only awarded to top 1% undergraduates at Hust.

I once went to Imperial College to attend Data Science Summer School in 2024, where I accomplished brain tumor segmentation based on UNet. Now I am working as an research intern at Lenovo, Shanghai, taking the responsibility of evaluating LLMs on different datasets. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In my daily life, I am interested in sports, music and movies. I love both soccer and basketball, and I love to go to the gym. I enjoy listening to Rock and R&B in my leisure time.

Now I am an incoming 25 fall CS PhD at Stevens Institute of Technology. You can find my curriculem Vitae here. [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) If you are also from stevens, or an incoming stevenser, feel free to contact me!

Publication
======
I am now having no publications, but I hope I can publish some high-quality papers during my PhD career.

Projects
======
In this part, I put some side projects on this website. Hope it can be interesting to you!

Imperial College Summer School
------
I attended Imperial Data Science Summer School in 2024 and accomplished Brain Tumor Segmentation based on UNet. I demonstrate my work report and the final result here. I hope AI can be ultilized to benefit human beings in many aspects, especially in healthcare.
